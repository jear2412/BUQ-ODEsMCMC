The purpose of this repository is to provide  several examples of MCMC methods in Python 3. The methods provided will tipically use libraries and packages already developed. The methods being exemplified are


1) t walk
2) emcee
3) Repelling-Attracting Metropolis (RAM)
4) Hamiltonian MC
5) Parallel Tempering MC
6) Random scan Gibbs sampling

Additional purposes include providing examples of parameter estimation in ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and multimodal posterior distributions.

If you would like me to work out a specific example or have any doubts please contact me at javier.aguilar at cimat dot mx .
