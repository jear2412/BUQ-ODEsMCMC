The purpose of this repository is to provide with several examples of MCMC methods in Python 3. The methods provided will tipically use libraries and packages already developed. The methods being exemplified are


1) t walk
2) emcee
3) Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM)
4) Repelling-Attracting Metropolis (RAM)
5) Kernel density MCMC
6) Hamiltonian MC

Additional purposes include providing examples of parameter estimation in ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and multimodal posterior distributions.

If you would like me to work out an specific example or have any doubts please contact me at javier.aguilar at cimat dot mx .
