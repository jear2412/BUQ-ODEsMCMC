The purpose of this repository is to provide with several examples of MCMC methods in Python 3. The methods provided will tipically use libraries and packages already developed. The methods being exemplified are


1) t walk
2) emcee
3) Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM)
4) Repelling-Attracting Metropolis (RAM)
5) Kernel density MCMC
6) Hamiltonian MC
